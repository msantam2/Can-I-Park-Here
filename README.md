# Can I Park Here?
Use computer vision to allow mere mortals to interpret complex parking signs in LA and beyond, using only their iPhone

##### Main Details
- iOS mobile application written in Swift
- Harnesses Firebase ML Kit (Î²) for on-device image-based Text Recognition to read parking signs

##### Future Features
- Drop a pin on user's phone so they can remember where they parked
- If user can park in space for only a finite amount of time (say, another 35 minutes before street cleaning begins), allow user to set up Reminder on their phone to move their car
- If user can park in space for only 5-10 more minutes (a very SMALL finite amount), warn user that they may want to look for parking elsewhere
- Improve accuracy of Computer Vision, perhaps utilizing Cloud-based API's instead of on-device, although on-device is faster and may be used offline. Examine trade-offs.
